# WP Broadbean

[WP Broadbean](http://wpbroadbean.com/ "Broadbean posted jobs on your WordPress website") is a plugin designed to work alongside the Broadbean Adcourier job posting system allowing jobs added posted through Broadbean to show in your WordPress site. The plugin adds custom post types and taxonomies to allow you to add jobs. More importantly it provides an end-point to accept feed data sent by Broadbean and add this as job posts to your site.
