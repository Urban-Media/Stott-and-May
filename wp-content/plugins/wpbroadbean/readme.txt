WP Broadbean is a plugin allowing jobs added to Broadbean to show in your WordPress site.

== Description ==

[WP Broadbean](http://wpbroadbean.com/ "Broadbean posted jobs on your WordPress website") is a plugin designed to work alongside the Broadbean Adcourier job posting system allowing jobs added to Broadbean to show in your WordPress site. The plugin adds custom post types and taxonomies to allow you to add jobs. More importantly it provides an end-point to accept feed data sent by Broadbean and add this as job posts to your site.

You can find out more about the WP Broadbean plugin on the [WP Broadbean website](http://wpbroadbean.com/ "Broadbean posted jobs on your WordPress website").

We also offer a service to complete a Broadbean integration with WordPress for you. Find out more about our [WPBB Assist service here](http://wpbroadbean.com/assist/).

>If you are running a version of WP Broadbean less than version 2.0 please DO NOT UPDATE.

== Installation ==

To install the plugin:

1. Upload `wpbroadbean` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the settings page under WP Broadbean > Settings
4. Enter a username and password as well as choosing a page to use for your application form.
5. View the how to get start question in the FAQs

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How do I get started?**

Your first task is to contact Broadbean and let them know that you want to create a new feed from your Broadbean Adcourier account to your WordPress website. It is also important to tell them that your integration will be using the WP Broadbean Plugin by Mark Wilkinson. You will need to indicate that you require the standard feed to be setup for this plugin without any changes being made.

**Do Broadbean charge for this?**

Probably yes! Contact your Broadbean account manager in order to get a price for developing a feed to your WordPress website.

**What is the URL to which Broadbean should post the feed too?**

The URL to post to, in order to add a job is http://domain.com/?wpbb=broadbean (of course replacing domain.com with your actual domain). The end-point expects an XML feed using the standard Broadbean XML feed.

**Can I customise the how the feed is added to WordPress?**

Yes you can. The plugin is built with extensibility in mind and therefore you can make many changes and edits without altering the plugin code itself. This will protect you when the plugin is updated. The plugin handles the incoming feed in the `inbox.php` file in the plugin root folder. If you copy this file to your active theme and place it in a folder named `wpbb` this will be used instead of the plugins version. Therefore you can make amends and change how the jobs are added when posted from Broadbean.

**What if I want different meta data and taxonomies than the standard ones, can the plugin handle that?**

Broadbean can build you a completely bespoke feed to your site, with practically any date you want about each job you post. The WP Broadbean Plugin can handle this through its extensibility features. You can add fields and taxonomies as well as remove the default ones should you wish too. The plugin was built with extensibility in mind with a number of actions and filters available to developers. Take a look at the source code for `do_action` and `apply_filters`.

== Changelog ==

= 2.2.1 =
* Allow jobs to be edited once they are sent through from Broadbean. If a job is sent with the same reference as an existing job in WordPress, the job will be updated rather than a new job being created. If you don't not want this functionality you can add the `add_filter( 'wpbb_allow_job_updates', '__return_false' );` to either your themes `functions.php` file or a plugin / mu-plugin.
* More strings are now translatable, particularly in the applications form and associated messages.

= 2.2 =
* Fix Duplicate Terms Showing. After WP 4.7.5 was released the `args` param in the `register_taxonomy` was causing the terms to be outputted twice. This was because of a change in the `wp_get_object_terms` function released with WP 4.7.5. Removing this param that is not needed fixes the problem.

= 2.1.9 =
* Remove attachment link from the application email - dead link since 2.1.6
* Remove the application attachments meta field
* Make all application form labels translatable
* Output the title of the job being applied for above the application form

* Allow application uploads to work on multisite - thanks to @sijones-uk for contribution here
* Add support for the job short description saved as the post excerpt

= 2.1.2 =
